# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `simulation-analysis.ipynb` notebook, and references therein. Before generating files for batch jobs, please create an empty folder named `jobs` under the root directory. Scripts for generating figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by simulations, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/7072019). Then download and extract the contents of the archive `data.zip` as the folder `/data`.
